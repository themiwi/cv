\textbf{ANDRITZ Hydro}\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Head of Turbine Digitalization (Linz)} \hfill \textbf{January 2019 -- Now}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Leading a team of five local and two remote developers. Expanded the
    team from four to seven developers, recruiting international developers
    from Austria, Vietnam and Brazil. Responsible for the delivery in time and
    on budget and project reporting.
  \item Development and maintenance of several software packages used
    internally by the R\&D, technical sales and turbine engineering
    departments built either in the .NET environment with C\#, WinForms,
    MS~SQL~Server, ASP.NET~WebApi or with C++, MariaDB and Qt. Python is
    frequently used for ad-hoc programs, data analysis and as glue between
    larger programs. Git with Bitbucket and Azure DevOps, Jira, Confluence and
    continuous integration with Jenkins are in heavy use to implement the agile
    project management, ensure high quality standards and create comprehensive
    project documentation.
  \item Creation of a new database for parametric CAD design based on the
    internal design instructions. Integration into existing systems and
    creation of interfaces for calculation and engineering tools, creating
    digital data flows. This system is built with .NET~Core WebApi, Angular,
    Blazor and Azure ActiveDirectory / OpenID Connect. The integration of
    services is done with an API gateway.
  \item Tight integration of several existing solutions and creation of digital
    data flows, reducing manual data entry and copying. The technology
    is very diverse, involving amongst others C++, WebApi and Python.
\end{list2}

\textsl{Development Engineer CAE Tools (Linz)} \hfill \textbf{August 2016 -- December 2018}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Agile master and system architect for the ANDRITZ Hydro industrial IoT
    solution METRIS DiOMera for the monitoring and operation optimization of
    hydro power plants; built on top of the ANDRITZ METRIS platform. The
    platform is constructed around a core based on MS~SQL~Server with Analysis
    Services, Entity~Framework, InfluxDB, WebApi and SignalR. Analytical
    modules are mostly built with Python, Pandas and scikit-learn and deployed
    as Docker containers. Ansible was used for the provisioning of resources
    and deployment to the Azure cloud.
  \item Application of machine learning and statistical analysis for the
    optimization of power plant operation and predictive maintenance.
    Proposing analysis methods, developing prototypes for analysis algorithms
    and providing the necessary domain knowledge to the data analysts. Here
    mostly Python, Jupyter notebooks and Pandas were used and, where suitable,
    Power~Query and Power~BI.
\end{list2}

\textsl{Development Engineer CAE Tools (Zürich and Vevey)} \hfill \textbf{May 2013 -- December 2018}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Head of an international working group for the harmonization of the
    high performance computing infrastructure between the various ANDRITZ Hydro
    R\&D sites.

  \item Further, developer and project manager of in-house engineering tools;
    patent contact for ANDRITZ Hydro to the group patents department; SCRUM
    master in multiple successful projects; architect and designer of multiple
    micro services. The programs were mostly built with C\#, WPF, WinForms,
    WebApi, MS~SQL~Server and Entity~Framework.
\end{list2}

\textbf{Basler Kantonalbank}\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Financial Engineer (Basel)} \hfill \textbf{January 2013 -- April 2013}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Development and maintenance of programs that process data from
    various trading systems and transfer it to the core banking software.
    A wide range of technologies (C, Perl, Python, IBM MQ, Sybase, Oracle DB)
    and operating systems (Windows, HP UX, IBM AIX, Solaris, RHEL) were
    involved.
\end{list2}

\textbf{Institute of Fluid Dynamics}, ETH Z\"urich\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Scientific Researcher (Zürich)} \hfill \textbf{June 2006 -- December 2012}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Creator of an MPI-parallel hybrid finite volume / transported
    joint-probability-density function (JPDF) solver for the simulation of
    turbulent reactive flows in C++ based on the OpenFOAM CFD library. The C++
    simulation code was developed on Linux. Python and ParaView were used for
    data processing and visualization.

  \item Inventor of several novel algorithms, improving the stability and
    efficiency of the hybrid FV-JPDF simulation method.
\end{list2}
