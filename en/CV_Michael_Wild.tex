\textbf{ANDRITZ Hydro}\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Team Leader Digitalization} \hfill \textbf{January 2019 -- Now}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Development and maintenance of several software packages used
    internally by the R\&D, technical sales and turbine engineering
    departments.
  \item Creation of a new database for parametric CAD design based on the
    internal design instructions. Integregation into existing systems and
    creation of interfaces for calculaion and engineering tools.
  \item Tightly integrate several existing solutions and create digital
    data flows, reducing manual data entry and copying.
\end{list2}

\textsl{Development Engineer CAE Tools} \hfill \textbf{May 2013 -- December 2018}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Agile master and system architect for the ANDRITZ Hydro industrial IoT
    solution for the monitoring and optimization of hydro power plants built on
    top of the ANDRITZ METRIS platform.

  \item Application of machine learning and statistical analysis for the
    optimization of power plant operation and predictive maintenance.
    Liaison between the engineering departments and data analytics teams,
    proposing analysis methods, developing prototypes for analysis algorithms
    and provided the necessary domain knowledge to the data analysts.

  \item Developer and project manager of in-house engineering tools, e.g.\ for
    the transients simulation of hydraulic power plants, their hydraulic
    layout, design and simulation tool chains.

  \item Patent contact for ANDRITZ Hydro to the group patents department.

  \item SCRUM master in two successful projects. Development progress was
    measurably accelerated and the important features were delivered earlier to
    the internal clients. The return on investment was improved considerably.

  \item Architect and designer of multiple micro services which are integrated
    via REST over HTTP. The individual services were developed by
    geographically far distributed teams.

  \item Creator of a preprocessing tool for the transient simulation of hydro
    power plants using C\# and WPF.

  \item Head of an international working group of eight members to elaborate a
    strategy for the harmonization of the high performance computing
    infrastructure between the various ANDRITZ Hydro R\&D sites.
\end{list2}

\textbf{Basler Kantonalbank}\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Financial Engineer} \hfill \textbf{January 2013 -- April 2013}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Development and maintenenance of programs that process data from
    various trading systems and transfer it to the core banking software.
\end{list2}

\textbf{Institute of Fluid Dynamics}, ETH Z\"urich\\\vspace{1mm}%
\textsl{Scientific Researcher} \hfill \textbf{June 2006 -- December 2012}\\
\vspace{-4mm}%
\begin{list2}
  \item Creator of an MPI-parallel hybrid finite volume / transported
    joint-probability-density function (JPDF) solver for the simulation of
    turbulent reactive flows in C++ based on the OpenFOAM CFD library.

  \item Inventor of a novel method for the coupling of the JPDF solver with the
    finite volume solver, a new consistent formulation for the inflow and
    outflow boundary conditions, an algorithm for the particle number control
    that preserves all moments of the JPDF and an algorithm for asynchronous,
    local time stepping for the particle evolution.

  \item Development of pre- and post-processing tools in Python.
\end{list2}
